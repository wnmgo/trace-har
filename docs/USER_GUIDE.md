# User Guide

## When to use this

Use `trace-har` when you have a Playwright trace (`trace.zip` or unpacked
folder) but no HAR. The converter rebuilds a complete HAR so you can replay or
inspect requests offline.

## Inputs

You can point the CLI at either:

- An unpacked trace directory that contains `trace.network` and `resources/`.
- A trace `.zip` file generated by Playwright.

## Basic command

```bash
pdm run trace-har archive --output reconstructed.har
```

## Options

- `--pretty`: Indent JSON for readability.
- `--overwrite`: Allow replacing an existing output file.

## Output validation

- Confirm that `log.entries` is populated in the HAR.
- Check that `response.content.text` exists for entries with `_sha1` resources.
- Verify that binary responses have `encoding: base64`.

## Troubleshooting

- Missing `trace.network` or `resources/`:
  - Ensure the trace was fully downloaded/unzipped.
- Binary responses look empty:
  - Confirm the corresponding `_sha1` file exists under `resources/`.
- Large output:
  - This is expected when embedding full response bodies.
